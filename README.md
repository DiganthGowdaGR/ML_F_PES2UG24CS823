- **student_lab.py** – Original lab skeleton (for reference)
- **test.py** – Testing and evaluation script (provided)
- **mushroom.csv** – Dataset 1
- **tictactoe.csv** – Dataset 2
- **Nursery.csv** – Dataset 3
- **README.md** – This file
- **temp.txt** – Temporary/extra notes (if any)
- **.gitignore** – Git ignore rules

---

# Lab 4 – Model Selection & Comparative Analysis  

**Name:** SHARATH GOWDA GR  
**SRN:** PES2UG24CS823  
**Course:** Machine Learning | **Lab:** Week 4  

---

## Highlights  
- Compared Manual Grid Search vs GridSearchCV  
- Datasets: Wine Quality, HR Attrition, Banknote Authentication, QSAR Biodegradation  
- Pipeline: StandardScaler → SelectKBest → Classifier  
- Models: Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression  
- Both methods gave consistent results; GridSearchCV was faster  
- Generated confusion matrices and ROC curves  
- Key learnings: pipelines, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation  

---

## Tools  
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
